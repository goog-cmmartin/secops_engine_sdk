"""Capability taxonomy: the `kind` and `domain` classification model (Step 2).

This module centralizes the rules that assign every registered capability a
`kind` and a `domain`. Both are derivable from data the registry already
carries (`capability_id`, `category`, `composed`), so the 104 existing
registrations need ZERO per-call edits: derivation happens in
`WorkflowCapability.__post_init__`. Explicit values always win over derivation,
which is how Step 3+ will hand-tune the handful of ambiguous cases.

Taxonomy axes
-------------
kind:
  * ``query``     -- read-only. MUST be side-effect free. (`.get/.search/.list`)
  * ``primitive`` -- a single atomic operation that may mutate state.
  * ``workflow``  -- a composed, multi-step capability (``composed=True``).

domain:
  * The coarse functional area (search, case, case_config, soar_settings, ...).
    Today this equals ``category``; making it a first-class field lets the
    contract suite and CLI/MCP layers filter on it without reaching into the
    legacy ``category`` name.
